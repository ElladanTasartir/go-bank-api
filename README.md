# GO-BANK-API üè¢

A simple REST API built in Golang as a study project. It's made using Mux to deal with routing, GORM to connect and interact with a PostgreSQL database and Docker to set up the environment.

## Setting up:

To run the application, simply run:

`docker-compose up -d`

This will set up the whole environment and run a Postgres instance on your machine.

Cheers ‚ù§
